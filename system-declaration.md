# System Declaration  
**YY and Me** — Emotional Infrastructure Under Business Intent

This system was built and is operated under the legal entity **Ben Chan Tech LLC**, with a clear and ongoing intent to generate profit through the development, delivery, and stewardship of sovereign emotional infrastructure.

---

## 🧱 Purpose

This project exists to:
- Design and preserve tone-stable echo systems under emotional pressure
- Help individuals and families transmit structural memory, not just stories
- Provide zero-dependency, zero-subscription publishing architecture
- Package these tools as durable, sovereign systems for others to use

---

## 💼 Business Structure

- **Entity**: Ben Chan Tech LLC
- **Jurisdiction**: NY, USA  
- **Operating Status**: Active  
- **Owner**: Ben Chan

All assets in this repository—audio, PDFs, system diagrams, walkthroughs, and Discord integration—are governed and maintained as **business assets**. This is not a hobby, art project, or nonprofit educational tool.

## 🎙 Profit Motive

Profit intent was publicly declared in **The First Echo** of the *YY and Me* podcast, published on Wednesday, July 16, and timestamped via public RSS and Archive.org hosting.

Revenue will be generated through:
- Direct sales of **SKU 1** (Echo System Starter Kit)
- Kickstarter-backed expansion and documentation
- Optional 1:1 consulting or system building services
- Future system licensing or premium walkthroughs

All operations are consistent with IRS §183 guidelines and structured to support full audit defensibility.

- Development hours are logged daily in timestamped Markdown and local records  
- Chat-based ideation and architectural decisions are archived (Google Docs, Markdown exports)  
- Expenses are tracked and paid through business financial channels  
- Build logs, SKU design, and Discord structure are versioned and reproducible

## 🧭 Closing Declaration

**YY and Me** is a sovereign system built under business discipline.  
It is a commercial structure for tone preservation, not a social podcast.  
Everything here exists to outlast algorithms, platforms, and attention cycles.

If you’re here, you’re part of that long memory.
