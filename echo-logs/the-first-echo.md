## The First Echo  
*This is where the ritual begins, and the canon starts to form.*

This form isn’t final—like the podcast, it’s part of the experiment.  
You’re witnessing the structure as it takes shape.

This is not feedback.  
It’s a ritual trace—a way to signal what resonated so I can listen, adjust, and evolve the canon.

You’re early, and that means your echo carries weight. I’ll read everything.  
Thank you for listening.
