  <h1>YY and Me</h1>
  <p>A podcast about memory, inheritance, and building stories that outlive us.</p>
</div>

<section>
  <p>
    <em>YY and Me</em> (yyand.me) started as a message-in-a-bottle to my kids and their future selves. It's part memoir, part experiment, and part live test of what I call 
    <strong>recursive narrative systems</strong>—stories designed to fold back on themselves, compounding meaning over time.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each episode uses the frameworks I've been building for years: story arcs tuned for memory, mnemonic music motifs, and diegetic sponsorships that weave support directly into the narrative. 
    It's not content. It's an inheritance you can listen to.

  <h2>The Source</h2>
  <p>
    The stuffed animal <strong>YY</strong>—my childhood companion and now co-narrator—anchors the series. He's the bridge between past and future, child and adult, memory and possibility.
    My family is the raw material: parenting chaos, inherited patterns, the weight of what we pass down.

  <h2>The Work Beyond</h2>
  <p>
    <em>YY and Me</em> sits inside a larger project: building frameworks that carry emotional weight across generations. That work now lives inside <a href="https://benchantech.com" target="_blank">my LLC</a>, where I help others create their own narrative systems—whether you're a founder, artist, or parent trying to architect something that lasts.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you want to help keep the podcast alive while I map these systems for others, you can do that quietly and directly through <a href="https://patreon.com/yyandme" target="_blank">Patreon</a>.

  <h2>The Invitation</h2>
  <p>
    Start with the podcast. If it resonates, the rest follows naturally. 
    This is still part memoir, part manifesto, part inheritance-in-progress.
