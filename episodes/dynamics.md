What’s the difference between accuracy and presence?

In this episode, Ben examines the emotional gap between correct delivery and real connection — in music, parenting, and apology. You’ll hear how dynamics (in volume, in voice, in behavior) can shift everything. This is a key episode on emotional intelligence in daily interaction.

**Keywords**: emotional dynamics, relational repair, musical expression and parenting, apology tone, emotional intelligence in families, trust-building through voice

<p>YY and Me Episode 3: Dynamics</p>
<p>(Opening motif – plucked AE-AE medium, DA–DA soft, GD loud.)</p>
<p>(Violin: dry, flat performance of something familiar—technically accurate, emotionally hollow)</p>
<p>(YY’s voice):</p>
<p>“Huh. That sounded weird.”</p>
<p>What?  Every note was right.</p>
<p>pause</p>
<p>grunt</p>
<p>Guess I just wasn’t feeling it.</p>
<p>(YY’s voice):</p>
<p>“Oh. That’s also weird. You… okay?”</p>
<p>Not sure.</p>
<p>Something’s off, but I can’t quite put my finger on it.</p>
<p>Has this ever happened to you?</p>
<p>You’re doing everything right—on paper.</p>
<p>But it still lands wrong.</p>
<p>The execution’s solid.</p>
<p>The confidence just… isn’t there.</p>
<p>Going through the motions is a common—and dangerous—cycle.</p>
<p>I see it a lot with third parties I work with.</p>
<p>Emails go unanswered.</p>
<p>Video calls feel stiff.</p>
<p>Something’s off, and no one says it out loud.</p>
<p>In music, we call this dynamics.</p>
<p>Forte means loud.</p>
<p>Piano means soft.</p>
<p>My earlier playing?</p>
<p>It stayed mezzo-forte—medium—start to finish.</p>
<p>Accurate.</p>
<p>But boring.</p>
<p>Forgettable.</p>
<p>Now think back.</p>
<p>That moment with my kid—</p>
<p>the homework lecture.</p>
<p>Was I really talking to them…</p>
<p>or just repeating something I’d practiced in my head?</p>
<p>Did I pause?</p>
<p>Listen to what they needed?</p>
<p>Or was I just… performing?</p>
<p>Same with the shipper who missed a deadline.</p>
<p>Did I ask what happened?</p>
<p>Or just fire off a reprimand?</p>
<p>Did I even read their response—</p>
<p>really read it?</p>
<p>(YY’s voice):</p>
<p>“Sometimes… you just screw up.”</p>
<p>Fair point, YY.</p>
<p>But I’m training for that.</p>
<p>Not to be perfect—</p>
<p>Just to notice it sooner.</p>
<p>(YY’s voice):</p>
<p>“I still don’t get it.”</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Let’s go back to that violin passage from earlier.</p>
<p>[Replay flat version.]</p>
<p>Now let’s add some dynamics.</p>
<p>[Play with full dynamic range.]</p>
<p>(YY’s voice):</p>
<p>“Wow. That sounds way better!”</p>
<p>I think so, too.</p>
<p>But here’s the cold truth—</p>
<p>If you hadn’t said something earlier…</p>
<p>I wouldn’t have noticed.</p>
<p>I couldn’t hear it myself.</p>
<p>(YY’s voice):</p>
<p>“I did that?”</p>
<p>You did.</p>
<p>Sometimes, all it takes is someone saying it out loud.</p>
<p>But that takes intuition.</p>
<p>Courage.</p>
<p>And respect, too.</p>
<p>In fact, here’s a recent example.</p>
<p>One of my kids was having a rough evening.</p>
<p>I was exhausted—long day at work.</p>
<p>I got sharp.</p>
<p>Sharper than I should’ve been.</p>
<p>And I didn’t realize it…</p>
<p>Until a hand touched my shoulder.</p>
<p>I turned—expecting to see my wife—</p>
<p>But it was my oldest.</p>
<p>“I think you’re being a little harsh, Dad.”</p>
<p>My first instinct was to defend.</p>
<p>Say I was tired. That they were overreacting.</p>
<p>But something cut through before I spoke.</p>
<p>That quiet voice again.</p>
<p>“You’re right,” I said.</p>
<p>Then I apologized—to both of them.</p>
<p>The mood shifted.</p>
<p>Not just theirs—mine.</p>
<p>I felt like myself again.</p>
<p>(YY’s voice):</p>
<p>“Was that voice… me?”</p>
<p>Was it?</p>
<p>I want to say yes…</p>
<p>But I think I just needed to hear it from someone else.</p>
<p>Because knowing what to fix is one thing.</p>
<p>Fixing it together? That’s harder.</p>
<p>(YY’s voice):</p>
<p>“So, it’s fixed now!”</p>
<p>pause</p>
<p>(YY’s voice):</p>
<p>“...Ben?”</p>
<p>(As if snapping out of deep reflection)</p>
<p>Ah—sorry. Yeah, I think so?</p>
<p>I mean… this time, it turned out okay.</p>
<p>Next time?</p>
<p>(YY’s voice):</p>
<p>“Hmm.”</p>
<p>(Closing motif)</p>
