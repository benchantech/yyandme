<p>YY and Me Episode 3: Dynamics</p>

<p>(Opening motif – plucked AE-AE medium, DA–DA soft, GD loud.)</p>

<p>(Violin: dry, flat performance of something familiar—technically accurate, emotionally hollow)</p>

<p>(YY’s voice): “Huh. That sounded weird.”</p>

<p>What? Every note was right.</p>

<p>[pause] [grunt]</p>

<p>Guess I just wasn’t feeling it.</p>

<p>(YY’s voice): “Oh. That’s also weird. You… okay?”</p>

<p>Not sure. Something’s off, but I can’t quite put my finger on it.</p>

<p>Has this ever happened to you? You’re doing everything right—on paper. But it still lands wrong.</p>

<p>The execution’s solid. The confidence just… isn’t there.</p>

<p>Going through the motions is a common—and dangerous—cycle. I see it a lot with third parties I work with. Emails go unanswered. Video calls feel stiff. Something’s off, and no one says it out loud.</p>

<p>In music, we call this dynamics. Forte means loud. Piano means soft.</p>

<p>My earlier playing? It stayed mezzo-forte—medium—start to finish. Accurate. But boring. Forgettable.</p>

<p>Now think back. That moment with my kid—the homework lecture. Was I really talking to them… or just repeating something I’d practiced in my head? Did I pause? Listen to what they needed? Or was I just… performing?</p>

<p>Same with the shipper who missed a deadline. Did I ask what happened? Or just fire off a reprimand? Did I even read their response—really read it?</p>

<p>(YY’s voice): “Sometimes… you just screw up.”</p>

<p>Fair point, YY. But I’m training for that. Not to be perfect—just to notice it sooner.</p>

<p>(YY’s voice): “I still don’t get it.”</p>

<p>Okay. Let’s go back to that violin passage from earlier.</p>

<p>[Replay flat version.]</p>

<p>Now let’s add some dynamics.</p>

<p>[Play with full dynamic range.]</p>

<p>(YY’s voice): “Wow. That sounds way better!”</p>

<p>I think so, too. But here’s the cold truth—if you hadn’t said something earlier… I wouldn’t have noticed. I couldn’t hear it myself.</p>

<p>(YY’s voice): “I did that?”</p>

<p>You did. Sometimes, all it takes is someone saying it out loud. But that takes intuition. Courage. And respect, too.</p>

<p>In fact, here’s a recent example. One of my kids was having a rough evening. I was exhausted—long day at work. I got sharp. Sharper than I should’ve been. And I didn’t realize it… until a hand touched my shoulder.</p>

<p>I turned—expecting to see my wife—but it was my oldest.</p>

<p>“I think you’re being a little harsh, Dad.”</p>

<p>My first instinct was to defend. Say I was tired. That they were overreacting. But something cut through before I spoke. That quiet voice again.</p>

<p>“You’re right,” I said. Then I apologized—to both of them. The mood shifted. Not just theirs—mine. I felt like myself again.</p>

<p>(YY’s voice): “Was that voice… me?”</p>

<p>Was it? I want to say yes… but I think I just needed to hear it from someone else. Because knowing what to fix is one thing. Fixing it together? That’s harder.</p>

<p>(YY’s voice): “So, it’s fixed now!”</p>

<p>[pause]</p>

<p>(YY’s voice): “...Ben?”</p>

<p>(As if snapping out of deep reflection) Ah—sorry. Yeah, I think so? I mean… this time, it turned out okay. Next time?</p>

<p>(YY’s voice): “Hmm.”</p>

<p>(Closing motif)</p>
