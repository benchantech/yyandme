**Welcome to _YY and Me_** â€” a podcast about identity, imagination, and learning out loud.

This opening episode is both manifesto and experiment. Ben introduces the concept behind *YY and Me*, blending memoir, sound design, and emotional inquiry. Youâ€™ll hear why heâ€™s shifting from viral YouTube violinist to sovereign audio creator â€” and how stuffed animals, language immersion, and vulnerability are central to the structure.

This episode outlines four creative experiments:
1. **Mnemonic memory cues** using violin plucks
2. **Intimate storytelling** focused on identity, growth, and repair
3. **Original music performance** as narrative language
4. **Diegetic sponsorship**: ads fully integrated into the world of the story

Whether youâ€™re a creator, a parent, or someone rebuilding your voice, this episode lays the foundation.
