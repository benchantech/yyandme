<p>YY and Me Episode 1: Ben Chan and YY, Timelessly Bound</p>
<p>(Opening motif – plucked AE–AE, DA–DA, GD)</p>
<p>Hi everyone – it’s Ben Chan. And this is my furry little sidekick, YY.</p>
<p>YY’s voice:</p>
<p>“Testing… testing… um, this is WEIRD.”</p>
<p>It is, and that’s the point, actually.</p>
<p>YY’s voice:</p>
<p>“Whaat?”</p>
<p>Yeah. This is my – our – opportunity to tell our story.</p>
<p>What we’ve built, what we’re building, and…</p>
<p>YY’s voice:</p>
<p>“Yeah?”</p>
<p>Yup. Let’s just be ourselves.</p>
<p>Ready? Here goes.</p>
<p>Around 40 years ago, my parents bought me a stuffed animal.</p>
<p>He was a furry, reddish-brown squirrel with a Y-shaped nose.</p>
<p>I don’t remember exactly where the name came from, but it stuck. YY.</p>
<p>My mom made a yellowish bear we called Jason Junior—modeled after Home Ec creations my brother and I made in middle school.</p>
<p>Ducky was a bluish, bird-looking guy with a quiet charm.</p>
<p>Jason Junior, Ducky, and YY became a trio of recurring heroes in my drawings and stories.</p>
<p>Over time, Jason Junior’s neck frayed slowly, and Ducky’s wings and legs came off.</p>
<p>YY has definitely aged as well, looking more and more frail.</p>
<p>But their personalities, experiences, and sentimental value have deepened.</p>
<p>Actually, Jason Junior is tucked away in a crate, alongside my journals and awards from school.</p>
<p>Ducky is currently perched on top of my bedroom dresser.</p>
<p>YY plays with the kids regularly.</p>
<p>The trio is still home.</p>
<p>YY’s voice:</p>
<p>“You got that right!”</p>
<p>I sure did.</p>
<p>Together, these three fueled my early childhood.</p>
<p>I spent a lot of time playing in my room, alone, inventing voices and backstories and plots.</p>
<p>I was a pretty shy kid overall.</p>
<p>I rarely raised my hand in class, often ate lunch alone, and felt like a shadow compared to my siblings—both older and younger.</p>
<p>But when I was with my stuffed animals, I felt different.</p>
<p>I was the creator of worlds, orchestrator of emotion…</p>
<p>YY’s voice:</p>
<p>“Captain of… the Author Ship!”</p>
<p>Uh, sure, YY.</p>
<p>Captain of the, uh, Author Ship – that works.</p>
<p>And the thing is, part of my mind was inventing through my characters.</p>
<p>My imagination unlocked when I looked at ideas through each lens.</p>
<p>They all came from me, but partitioned—separated into distinct roles.</p>
<p>Of course, I had no idea I was doing this back then.</p>
<p>YY has absolutely kept my inner kid alive.</p>
<p>It’s not every day you see a seasoned professional wearing a tie with a squirrel-shaped clip—handmade by one of his kids.</p>
<p>Or a crate full of The Adventures of YY tucked behind old journals and awards.</p>
<p>All still here.</p>
<p>YY’s voice:</p>
<p>“Yup, we’re all still here. So… what’s next?”</p>
<p>Honestly, you’ve gotten me through a lot.</p>
<p>At 42, I’ve seen well-intentioned plans fall apart—in music, business… family.</p>
<p>Maybe there are other people – parents, professionals, builders – who could learn something from what we’ve lived.</p>
<p>YY’s voice:</p>
<p>“Worth a try, I guess!”</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>Next time, we’ll talk about practice.</p>
<p>And what happens when you keep doing something over and over…</p>
<p>but it still doesn’t work.</p>
<p>See you then.</p>
<p>YY’s voice:</p>
<p>“Bye!”</p>
<p>(Closing motif)</p>
