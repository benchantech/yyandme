What if your most viral work carries unresolved ethical weight?

In the close of Arc 1, Ben opens up about his early YouTube career — and the blurry lines between artistic intention and copyright tension. This is about the legacy of your past self, and what happens when your old work no longer reflects your current integrity.

<p>YY and Me Episode 4: Emotion</p>
<p>(Opening motif – plucked AE-AE medium, pause, GD-GD-GD-GD…GD! soft cresc to loud, bartok snap.)</p>
<p>(YY’s voice): “Hi, Ben! Whatcha doin’?”</p>
<p>[pause]</p>
<p>Hmm? Oh. Just reading.</p>
<p>(YY’s voice): “Ah. …Whatcha readin’?”</p>
<p>[pause]</p>
<p>It’s… complicated.</p>
<p>(YY’s voice): “Huh?”</p>
<p>I’ve got a lot of thinking to do.</p>
<p>(YY’s voice): “About what?”</p>
<p>[pause]</p>
<p>I’m not sure I’m ready to talk about it.</p>
<p>(YY’s voice): “Okay... but um, I’m here.”</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>(opening phrase of song on violin, which is an original I composed that is deeply reflective and dissonant: CC#G#EEb-B-D—-C—-----.  Violin stops)</p>
<p>I often play something like this to help me when I’m feeling stuck.  It helps me calm down. Focus.</p>
<p>I’m not sure YY would understand this one.</p>
<p>Or maybe… I’m just afraid he’ll take it too lightly.</p>
<p>Either way, I’m working through it alone.</p>
<p>It’s… really emotionally charged for me.</p>
<p>D-M-C-A.</p>
<p>Digital Millennium Copyright Act.</p>
<p>I launched a YouTube channel—BenChanViolin—in 2007.</p>
<p>My first few videos? Awkward little teaching moments.</p>
<p>Then I discovered the magical world of music covers.</p>
<p>My unfair advantage?</p>
<p>Perfect pitch.</p>
<p>A few listens, and I can replay almost anything with a melody.</p>
<p>Great for me.</p>
<p>Not so great for the people who actually wrote it.</p>
<p>I’ve got a number of videos with over a hundred thousand views.</p>
<p>Some are technical demonstrations—teaching, not performing.</p>
<p>Fair Use hinges on four things: purpose, nature, amount, and effect.</p>
<p>It’s not a free pass—it’s a gray zone, judged in hindsight.</p>
<p>But I feel good about threading the needle on those.</p>
<p>But most of my videos?</p>
<p>Most either stretch Fair Use… or ignore it entirely.</p>
<p>Straight-up violin covers.</p>
<p>Which, legally speaking, aren’t allowed.</p>
<p>Coming back from a two-year YouTube hiatus gave me a chance to reset.</p>
<p>A chance to end the balancing act—and demonstrate restraint.</p>
<p>From here on out, my videos will respect Fair Use.</p>
<p>They’ll still teach. Still entertain.</p>
<p>But what about the long tail?</p>
<p>The older uploads.</p>
<p>The ones I know now… crossed the line.</p>
<p>What do I do with those?</p>
<p>How do I live with that complexity?</p>
<p>[pause]</p>
<p>Let’s spell this out real clearly.</p>
<p>One of my most-watched videos—over 2 million views—is a violin cover from a well-known anime.</p>
<p>It’s the one people write to me about.</p>
<p>The one they say got them into the show… or into violin altogether.</p>
<p>Back then, I monetized it.</p>
<p>I was a college music student—honestly just grateful anyone was tuning in.</p>
<p>It felt like a win-win: fans got something meaningful, and I got a little income.</p>
<p>No one complained.</p>
<p>But I didn’t fully understand what I was doing.</p>
<p>Not until years later, when I worked on a DMCA-related client project—</p>
<p>and realized this wasn’t just gray.</p>
<p>It was red. Violation red.</p>
<p>The full weight didn’t hit me at once.</p>
<p>It crept in, slowly.</p>
<p>And I kept waiting for someone—anyone—to say something.</p>
<p>A publisher. A licensor. A fellow creator.</p>
<p>But no one did.</p>
<p>YouTube didn’t have clear licensing paths back then.</p>
<p>It was the Wild West—</p>
<p>and we were kids armed with cameras and instruments, just trying to make something beautiful for others.</p>
<p>I’ve since demonetized that video.</p>
<p>No one told me to, but…</p>
<p>I can’t justify profiting from something I didn’t create.</p>
<p>A few of my other videos eventually got flagged.</p>
<p>Every time, I conceded immediately.</p>
<p>Rev share? Let’s do it.</p>
<p>Takedown? No argument.</p>
<p>They could’ve pushed harder.</p>
<p>But they didn’t.</p>
<p>Maybe they saw the good faith.</p>
<p>Maybe they just moved on.</p>
<p>Still—</p>
<p>some of those same creators built massive followings off unlicensed covers.</p>
<p>Like me, they weren’t trying to exploit anything.</p>
<p>They were trying to inspire, to share joy.</p>
<p>And yet…</p>
<p>knowing what I know now,</p>
<p>I can’t pretend those early choices were clean.</p>
<p>They weren’t.</p>
<p>But they weren’t meaningless either.</p>
<p>Some of those covers lit a spark.</p>
<p>Inspired hundreds, even thousands of people to play.</p>
<p>To feel something.</p>
<p>To start living.</p>
<p>So what do I do now?</p>
<p>[pause]</p>
<p>You know what—</p>
<p>I do need YY for this one.</p>
<p>Hang on.</p>
<p>(YY’s voice) “Hi, Ben!”</p>
<p>Thanks for coming back.</p>
<p>Sorry about earlier.</p>
<p>(YY’s voice) (without skipping a beat)</p>
<p>“No problem! What’s up?”</p>
<p>So… remember that video I posted last week?</p>
<p>The one where I said I was going to take down all my old videos?</p>
<p>(YY’s voice)</p>
<p>“I mean, YEAH.”</p>
<p>I took that video down.</p>
<p>[pause]</p>
<p>(YY’s voice)</p>
<p>“Yeah, I know.”</p>
<p>Was that the right thing to do?</p>
<p>[pause]</p>
<p>(YY’s voice) (lightbulb flicking on)</p>
<p>“Ohhh. That’s what this is about?”</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>(YY’s voice)</p>
<p>“Okay, so… you changed your mind, and… and…”</p>
<p>[pause]</p>
<p>(YY’s voice)</p>
<p>“Didn’t a lot of other people do the same thing?”</p>
<p>Make music covers, without respecting Fair Use?  …Yeah, they did.</p>
<p>[pause]</p>
<p>“Do they… still do it?”</p>
<p>Yeah, some of them do.</p>
<p>(YY’s voice)</p>
<p>“Does that… matter to you?”</p>
<p>[pause]</p>
<p>It does.</p>
<p>[longer pause]</p>
<p>(YY’s voice, softer)</p>
<p>“…What are you going to do?”</p>
<p>I’m going to talk to some creator buddies.</p>
<p>Then… a few composers I respect.</p>
<p>Ask questions.</p>
<p>Figure this out—together.</p>
<p>(YY’s voice)</p>
<p>“Whoa.”</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>This one’s not a quick fix.</p>
<p>It’s an ongoing conversation.</p>
<p>But it feels… like the right next step.</p>
<p>My gut agrees.</p>
<p>(YY’s voice)</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>(violin plays the full piece)</p>
<p>This piece is called “Inflection”.  Written and performed by Ben Chan.</p>
<p>(NO Closing motif)</p>
