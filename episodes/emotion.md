What happens when the story overtakes the storyteller?

In this episode, Ben reflects on the cost of forgetting — how AI, ambition, and the pursuit of perfection can quietly erode presence. It’s a raw exploration of creative practice, journaled memory, and the emotional toll of upgrading your voice while your kids wait downstairs. If Episode 3 traced dynamics, this one confronts dissonance — internal, inherited, and unresolved.

**Keywords**: AI and emotional distortion, creative detachment, memory and voice, journaling as parenting, burnout signals, presence versus performance, intergenerational authorship

<p>Episode 4: Emotion</p>
<p>YY and Me Episode 4: Emotion</p>

<p>(Opening motif – plucked AE-AE medium, pause, GD-GD-GD-GD…GD! soft cresc to loud, bartok snap.)</p>

<p>(YY’s voice): “Hi, Ben! Whatcha doin’?”</p>
<p>[pause]</p>
<p>Hmm? Oh. Just reading.</p>
<p>(YY’s voice): “Ah. …Whatcha readin’?”</p>
<p>[pause]</p>
<p>It’s… complicated.</p>
<p>(YY’s voice): “Huh?”</p>
<p>I’ve got a lot of thinking to do.</p>
<p>(YY’s voice): “About what?”</p>
<p>[pause]</p>
<p>I’m not sure I’m ready to talk about it.</p>
<p>(YY’s voice): “Okay... but um, I’m here.”</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>(opening phrase of song on violin, which is an original I composed that is deeply reflective and dissonant: CC#G#EEb-B-D—-C—-----. Violin stops)</p>

<p>I often play something like this to help me when I’m feeling stuck. It helps me calm down. Focus.</p>
<p>I’m not sure YY would understand this one.</p>
<p>Or maybe… I’m just afraid he’ll take it too lightly.</p>
<p>Either way, I’m working through it alone.</p>
<p>It’s… really emotionally charged for me.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>When I was in 3rd grade, I bought a composition notebook.</p>
<p>Black binding, with white inkbots across the front and back.</p>
<p>200 pages of lined paper, double sided.</p>
<p>I can still remember the smell.</p>
<p>The sound of flipping through.</p>
<p>Skimming the entries.</p>
<p>The satisfying scratch of a Number 2 pencil.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>At school, our teacher gave us a simple task.</p>
<p>Start a journal.</p>
<p>Write an entry a few times a week.</p>
<p>Capture my 8-year-old thoughts.</p>
<p>Learn to write.</p>
<p>Find my voice.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>I loved writing in that composition notebook.</p>
<p>Every journal entry began with the date and time.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I would write about bus rides.</p>
<p>Other times, I would vent about my siblings.</p>
<p>On occasion, I said something insightful.</p>
<p>Realized years later.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>By the time I graduated high school</p>
<p>I had filled up 29 notebooks.</p>
<p>Hundred, maybe thousands of journal entries.</p>
<p>Comics of stuffed animals.</p>
<p>A trove of thoughts and feelings</p>
<p>Captured in each moment.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>My wife and I started a journal together.</p>
<p>I have it on my lap right now.</p>
<p>Brown cover, the word “JOURNAL” in all caps.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>We wrote in it periodically.</p>
<p>Thoughts, feelings, inspiration.</p>
<p>I predicted the gender of each child.</p>
<p>Timestamped. A lucky streak.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>She still writes a family letter every week.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>I, on the other hand…</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>It wasn’t for lack of trying.</p>
<p>I tried to start an online blog.</p>
<p>Several times, actually.</p>
<p>I wrote as myself.</p>
<p>Wrote from the perspective of YY.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>But the problem was</p>
<p>I couldn’t think of much to write.</p>
<p>Who wants to hear about my life?</p>
<p>What do I have to say that hasn’t already been said</p>
<p>By other dads</p>
<p>Thousands of times?</p>
<p>What makes me unique?</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>What’s the point?</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>Fast forward to June 2025.</p>
<p>Time to try again.</p>
<p>For real, this time.</p>
<p>Bought a new composition notebook.</p>
<p>A cover for my iPad mini, actually.</p>
<p>Impulse buy.</p>
<p>Looked nice.</p>
<p>It… seemed to make sense.</p>
<p>To me.</p>
<p>To my family, on the surface.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>So… familiar.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>This time, things would be different.</p>
<p>I would write to my kids.</p>
<p>Tell them about my life.</p>
<p>Embed lessons to uncover.</p>
<p>When they’re ready.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>How… do I write about myself?</p>
<p>It’s been so long.</p>
<p>I’ve forgotten how.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>Dusty case.</p>
<p>Hair a little worn.</p>
<p>Unraveling, loose strings.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>Just start.</p>
<p>Write a few words.</p>
<p>Something.</p>
<p>Anything.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>Practice.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>This hurts.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>It’s okay.</p>
<p>Start slow.</p>
<p>Same thing I tell my kids</p>
<p>When they’re struggling.</p>
<p>Funny how so much of what I’ve said to them</p>
<p>Reflects right back at me.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>And you know what?</p>
<p>I think it’s working.</p>
<p>Reading back what I’m writing</p>
<p>I can hear my voice.</p>
<p>A little disorganized</p>
<p>Meandering…</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>I need to speed this up.</p>
<p>Time is king.</p>
<p>My wife is an excellent writer.</p>
<p>Her sense of tone, sharpened</p>
<p>By thousands of books.</p>
<p>Maybe she can help.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>I don’t want to bother her.</p>
<p>This burden is mine.</p>
<p>Alone.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>I need to find a power tool.</p>
<p>Something I can train with.</p>
<p>No external dependencies.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>What about… </p>
<p>AI?</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>Can you… help me improve my writing skills?</p>
<p>In isolation?</p>
<p>Read my drafts?</p>
<p>Tinker… a little?</p>
<p>Teach me?</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>That was fast.</p>
<p>So much output.</p>
<p>A skeletal frame.</p>
<p>Details carefully arranged.</p>
<p>Clean.</p>
<p>So clean.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>Too clean.</p>
<p>What did you do to my voice?</p>
<p>Where’s the expression?</p>
<p>The emotion?</p>
<p>It was there…</p>
<p>Before.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>I just need to practice more.</p>
<p>It’s like everything else, right?</p>
<p>Put in the time.</p>
<p>Ensure proper technique.</p>
<p>I’ve done this a million times before.</p>
<p>Different domain, but…</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>It’s the same thing, right?</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>Right?</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>What… time is it?</p>
<p>Shoot, I’m late.</p>
<p>Dinner’s already served.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>“Dad…</p>
<p>where are you?”</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>“Sorry.</p>
<p>Didn’t know you were still working.”</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>I just need a few more minutes.</p>
<p>Got to get this draft right.</p>
<p>Thread the needle.</p>
<p>(slight pause)</p>
<p>It’s getting more complicated.</p>
<p>But the story deserves it.</p>
<p>The story…</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>Did I just call it…</p>
<p>“The story”?</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>I’m writing this for my kids.</p>
<p>They won’t hear it now.</p>
<p>It’s for their future.</p>
<p>That’s why I need to use AI</p>
<p>To upgrade my voice</p>
<p>Faster. Better.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>To… upgrade my voice?</p>
<p>Ben.</p>
<p>Are you hearing yourself?</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>I was… </p>
<p>Writing to my kids.</p>
<p>In the future.</p>
<p>Not now.</p>
<p>And I forgot.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>They’re here.</p>
<p>Now.</p>
<p>And they need me.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>Right now.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>(violin plays the full piece)</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>The price of AI</p>
<p>Especially on emotions</p>
<p>Can be steep.</p>
<p>Merciless.</p>
<p>And the most dangerous part–</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>You didn’t see it coming.</p>
<p>And you have to pay.</p>

<p>[pause]</p>

<p>You know what—</p>
<p>I do need YY for this one.</p>
<p>Hang on.</p>

<p>(YY’s voice) “Hi, Ben!”</p>
<p>Thanks for coming back.</p>
<p>Sorry about earlier.</p>

<p>(YY’s voice) (without skipping a beat)</p>
<p>“No problem! What’s up?”</p>

<p>So… you know how I’ve been really busy?</p>
<p>Building something new?</p>

<p>(YY’s voice)</p>
<p>“I mean, YEAH.”</p>

<p>I… forgot to pay attention to my family.</p>

<p>[pause]</p>

<p>(YY’s voice)</p>
<p>“Yeah, I know.”</p>

<p>Was that the right thing to do?</p>

<p>[pause]</p>

<p>(YY’s voice) (lightbulb flicking on)</p>
<p>“Ohhh. That’s what this is about?”</p>

<p>It is.</p>

<p>(YY’s voice)</p>
<p>“Okay, so… you’ve been distracted, and… and…”</p>

<p>[pause]</p>

<p>(YY’s voice)</p>
<p>“Do you miss your kids?”</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>[pause]</p>

<p>“Do they… want your attention?”</p>

<p>They do.</p>

<p>(YY’s voice)</p>
<p>“Does that… matter to you?”</p>

<p>[pause]</p>

<p>It does.</p>

<p>[longer pause]</p>

<p>(YY’s voice, softer)</p>
<p>“…What are you going to do?”</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p>I just need a little more time.</p>
<p>To think.</p>

<p>(pause)</p>
