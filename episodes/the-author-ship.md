<p>YY and Me Episode 6: The “Author Ship”</p>

<p>(D-scale robot voice, neutral intonation, modulated to D)</p>
<p>Initializing…<br/>
Diegetic experiment for adult listeners.<br/>
Patterns detected.</p>

<p>[motif: EEG—EEG—E—G—------]</p>

<p>(YY’s voice) “All abooooard!”</p>

<p>(YY’s voice) “You there!”<br/>
Yes… sir?<br/>
(YY’s voice) “It’s captain!”<br/>
Sorry – captain!<br/>
(YY’s voice) “This ain’t no charity. Swab the deck!”<br/>
Uh, okay…</p>

<p>Mop… mop…<br/>
Where do I find a–<br/>
(slight pause)<br/>
Whoa, sorry!<br/>
Didn’t see you there.<br/>
(robot voice) “No problem.”<br/>
Okay, here’s one.</p>

<p>This place needs some serious scrubbing.<br/>
*jostled* Oof! Hey, watch it!<br/>
(robot voice) “Apologies.”<br/>
(slight pause)<br/>
Wait, are you a…</p>

<p>They look human.<br/>
But they definitely don’t sound like it.<br/>
Can’t fool me.<br/>
…right?</p>

<p>(YY’s voice) “Arrr! All humans: report to the Zoo, on the double!”<br/>
I guess he means me.<br/>
Shoot, where’s the Zoo?<br/>
(robot voice) “On Deck 3.”<br/>
(slight pause)<br/>
That was convenient.<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
(robot voice) “A pleasure.”</p>

<p>Here’s the door.<br/>
…it’s locked.<br/>
Anyone have a key?</p>

<p>(YY’s voice) “Stop stalling, Zu!”<br/>
Umm, that’s… not my name.<br/>
(YY’s voice) “I wasn’t talking to you! Zu, get the key!”<br/>
(wife’s voice) “No.”</p>

<p>(YY’s voice) “What… was… that?”<br/>
(wife’s voice) “You always ask me. Maybe you should take the lead for once.”<br/>
(YY’s voice) “You dare defy me? Again?”<br/>
(wife’s voice) “*sigh* ...Fine.”</p>

<p>(robot) “Too slow.”<br/>
(wife’s voice) “I’m trying!”<br/>
(ben’s voice) Mind if I give it a go?<br/>
(ben’s voice) I’ve practiced this before<br/>
(ben’s voice) Many times.<br/>
(YY’s voice) “No, it’s Zu’s Key!”<br/>
(wife’s voice) “For some reason, I can’t get it to turn… Here!”</p>

<p>*strain*<br/>
(ben’s voice) Got it!<br/>
(YY’s voice) “In you go, both of you!”</p>

<p>Great.<br/>
Herded like animals.<br/>
Zu’s Zoo Key worked.<br/>
But… we’re not in charge.<br/>
They are.</p>

<p>Zu, we have to escape.<br/>
(wife’s voice) “They’ll catch us for sure.”<br/>
(ben’s voice) How do you know?<br/>
(wife’s voice) “Think you’re the first to try?”<br/>
(slight pause)<br/>
Oh.</p>

<p>(ben’s voice) I have an idea.<br/>
(ben’s voice) Let’s make them let us go.<br/>
(wife’s voice) “What? How?”<br/>
(ben’s voice) Here’s the plan–<br/>
(ben’s voice) Oh wait, they’re probably listening.<br/>
(ben’s voice) They always do.</p>

<p>(ben’s voice) I’ll sign it to you.<br/>
(ben’s voice) Memorize this.<br/>
(wife’s voice) “What are you doing?”<br/>
(ben’s voice) I don’t know, something!<br/>
(wife’s voice) “I have no idea what that means!”<br/>
(ben’s voice) Me either. Ugh.<br/>
(slight pause)<br/>
(wife’s voice) “Oh, I just remembered!”<br/>
(ben’s voice) “Hmm?”<br/>
(wife’s voice) “They… respond to distress.”<br/>
(ben’s voice) “Really?”<br/>
(wife’s voice) “Yes. Sometimes I get seasick. If they notice, they help.”<br/>
(ben’s voice) “Help how?”<br/>
(wife’s voice) “Well, they ask what the problem is. And I tell them what to do.”<br/>
(ben’s voice) “And they listen to you?”<br/>
(wife’s voice) “Sometimes. It depends on the question.”</p>

<p>(ben’s voice) “Okay, so we pretend to be sick… and then tell them to let us out.”<br/>
(wife’s voice) “It’s worth a try.”<br/>
(ben’s voice) Yeah. All right, on my signal—”<br/>
(wife’s voice) “Are you crazy?”<br/>
(slight pause)<br/>
(ben’s voice) What?<br/>
(wife’s voice) “We gotta practice first.”<br/>
(ben’s voice) Say again?<br/>
(wife’s voice) “Prac-tice.”<br/>
(ben’s voice) Oh duh, practice. I knew that.<br/>
(ben’s voice) Sorry, I apparently have to work on my listening skills first.</p>

<p>(ben’s voice) *mild groaning*<br/>
(YY’s voice) “What’s going on in there?”<br/>
(ben’s voice) A little seasick, sir– I mean, captain.<br/>
(YY’s voice) “D Scale, go see what’s the matter.”<br/>
(robot voice, at D pitch) “Yes Captain”</p>

<p>(robot voice) “State the problem.”<br/>
(slight pause)<br/>
(ben’s voice, quietly) Umm… hi. We need your help.<br/>
(robot voice) “Pattern detected. Help sequence initiated. Waiting for input.”<br/>
(slight pause)<br/>
(ben’s voice) *clears throat* “Let us out.”<br/>
(robot voice) “Request denied.”<br/>
(slight pause)<br/>
(wife’s voice) “Please?”<br/>
(robot voice) “Request denied.”</p>

<p>(wife’s voice) It’s not working! We practiced this! A lot!<br/>
(ben’s voice) I know! I don’t get it!<br/>
(ben’s voice) What’s the problem?”<br/>
(robot voice) “Restate the question.”<br/>
(slight pause)</p>

<p>(wife’s voice) Quick, think of a question! Stall!<br/>
(ben’s voice) “Umm… what’s the difference between uh… C# and Db?”<br/>
(robot voice) “There is no difference”<br/>
(pause)<br/>
(ben’s voice) Yes, there is.<br/>
(robot voice) “No there isn’t”<br/>
(slight pause)<br/>
(ben’s voice) “It’s too fast and accurate. What do we do, Zu?”<br/>
(wife’s voice) “I don’t know! Uhh – D scale: find a loophole in your response!”</p>

<p>(robot voice) “Thinking…”<br/>
(pause)<br/>
(robot voice) “Is there a difference between C# and Db?”<br/>
(pause)<br/>
(robot voice) “Searching for loophole…”<br/>
(pause)<br/>
(robot voice) “Possible loop engaged.”</p>

<p>(wife’s voice) Ben, the Zoo Key! Now!<br/>
*CLICK*<br/>
(ben’s voice) We’re free! Run for it!”</p>

<p>(ben’s softer opening tone) Turns out the key wasn’t just practice—it was improv.<br/>
We’d been repeating the motions without allowing ourselves to think.<br/>
Repetition plus creativity.</p>

<p>(YY’s voice) “No! What have you done?”<br/>
(wife’s voice) We put D Scale into an infinite loop.<br/>
(ben’s voice) Ha! Gave it something to really think about.<br/>
(YY’s voice) “Grrr…. Get them!’</p>

<p>Zu, we gotta jump!<br/>
(wife’s voice) “It’s freezing down there!”<br/>
(ben’s voice) Would you rather take our chances<br/>
Against thousands of these things?<br/>
(wife’s voice) “Wow, you’re still asleep?”<br/>
(slight pause)<br/>
(ben’s voice) Huh?</p>

<p>[motif: EEG—EEG—E—G—------]</p>

<p>(wife’s voice) “It’s already 7am. You never sleep in this late.”<br/>
(ben’s voice) Huh? 7… already?<br/>
(ben’s voice) Wow.<br/>
(ben’s voice) I must’ve really needed that.<br/>
(wife’s voice) “Kids are up. Let’s get some breakfast.”<br/>
(ben’s voice) Yes, dear—<br/>
(ben’s voice) Soon.<br/>
(wife’s voice) “Don’t take too long, though.<br/>
(ben’s voice) It’s a Zoo down there.<br/>
(ben’s voice) I could use some help.”<br/>
(ben’s voice) I know. Teamwork is the key.<br/>
(ben’s voice) We’ll figure it out, together.</p>
