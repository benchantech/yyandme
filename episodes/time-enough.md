What happens when time itself becomes a debt?

Ben unpacks the invisible interest we pay balancing work, family, and self. Childhood coding sessions, crumpled violin notes, and a quiet stuffed squirrel map a lifetime of borrowed hours and deferred choices. Itâ€™s a meditation on opportunity cost, emotional mortgages, and what it means to live on borrowed time while trying to leave something lasting.

**Keywords**: time debt, emotional mortgages, work-life balance, parenting and legacy, opportunity cost, creative sacrifice, violin and coding, borrowed hours, introspection and presence

<p>Ben, how do you manage your time effectively between work, family and yourself?</p>

<p>This deserves a longer answer than I can give.</p>
<p>I'm still catching my breath from the last time.</p>

<p>(YY's voice): "I'll do it!"</p>

<p>Sorry YY, butâ€¦ that's not how this works.</p>
<p>Remember?</p>

<p>(YY's voice): "...you never let me steer."</p>

<p>Yeahâ€¦ sorry little buddy.</p>
<p>I'm aware.</p>

<p>How do I manage my time effectively?</p>
<p>Honestlyâ€¦ not as well as I could.</p>
<p>But I'm trying.</p>

<p>[pause]</p>

<p>You know, I've played over 10,000 hours of violin.</p>
<p>Written code for double that.</p>
<p>Learned several languagesâ€”</p>
<p>each one taught me something different.</p>
<p>Pretty good, on paper.</p>

<p>[pause]</p>

<p>But at what cost?</p>

<p>[pause]</p>

<p>I learned to code pretty young.</p>
<p>My first program?</p>
<p>An arrow, crawling left to right across the screen</p>
<p>Of an old Commodore 64.</p>
<p>No loops. Just repetition.</p>
<p>Manual movement.</p>

<p>[pause]</p>

<p>Hours slipped past faster than I realized I was spending them.</p>

<p>[pause]</p>

<p>When I was a little bit older, my brother wrote a game.</p>
<p>He called it "Lewch."</p>
<p>We played it often.</p>
<p>Together.</p>

<p>[pause]</p>

<p>It helped us bond.</p>
<p>Which is more than I can say</p>
<p>for almost anyone else outside our family.</p>

<p>[pause]</p>

<p>These days, I've started logging where the hours go.</p>
<p>My kids have been asking.</p>
<p>My wife's concerned.</p>
<p>I'mâ€¦ apparently in the red.</p>
<p>A little bit negative.</p>

<p>(YY's voice): "Maybe you're still borrowing."</p>

<p>[pause]</p>

<p>Borrowing? From what?</p>

<p>(YY's voice): "Not what. Whom."</p>

<p>[pauseâ€”darker]</p>

<p>Huh.</p>
<p>Some of those debtsâ€¦</p>
<p>I think they're coming due.</p>

<p>When you take out a mortgage</p>
<p>on something you believe you need</p>
<p>it lets you do what you couldn't before.</p>
<p>The bank gives you money.</p>
<p>You spend it, take a risk.</p>
<p>Believe it'll grow.</p>
<p>Faster than the interest.</p>

<p>And it feels good.</p>
<p>Really good.</p>
<p>Like clean air in your lungs</p>
<p>after holding your breath too long.</p>

<p>[pause]</p>

<p>Then the dioxide returns.</p>
<p>And you choke.</p>

<p>There was this one moment in high school.</p>
<p>Gym class. Weight room.</p>

<p>[pause]</p>

<p>I had scrawny arms back then.</p>
<p>Still kinda do.</p>

<p>[pause]</p>

<p>My teacher walked over.</p>
<p>Stopped in front of me.</p>
<p>Looked down at my hand.</p>
<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>He pointed.</p>
<p>Something white.</p>
<p>A note.</p>

<p>[pause]</p>

<p>"It'sâ€¦ from my violin teacher." I said,</p>
<p>Trying to keep my voice level.</p>

<p>[pauseâ€”longer]</p>

<p>The paper uncrumpled.</p>
<p>Louder than it should have been.</p>
<p>He frowned.</p>
<p>Audibly.</p>

<p>[pause]</p>

<p>That note didn't just buy me out of gym class.</p>
<p>It bought me an hour I couldn't get back.</p>

<p>[slightly longer pause]</p>

<p>Fast forward several weeks.</p>
<p>I was on stage.</p>
<p>In front of an orchestra.</p>
<p>Wearing a dark suit, matching shoes.</p>
<p>Performing the Beethoven Violin Concerto.</p>

<p>No strained muscles.</p>

<p>(YY's voice): "Hey, I still had to lift weights!"</p>

<p>Opportunity cost? Getting there.</p>
<p>Arms still scrawny.</p>
<p>Legs, unsculpted.</p>
<p>Another crumpled note.</p>
<p>Back on the sidelinesâ€¦</p>
<p>Watching the others play.</p>
<p>Together.</p>
<p>Without me.</p>

<p>[pause]</p>

<p>I'mâ€¦ indebted to the violin.</p>
<p>Just not how I expect sometimes.</p>

<p>[pause]</p>

<p>Remember how I told you</p>
<p>That I was a pretty shy kid?</p>

<p>[pause]</p>

<p>My time was already mortgaged</p>
<p>to music,</p>
<p>to coding.</p>
<p>No time for much else.</p>
<p>Not even Chinese school.</p>

<p>[pause]</p>

<p>My parents noticed.</p>
<p>Didn't push back, much.</p>

<p>[pause]</p>

<p>I noticeâ€¦ now.</p>

<p>(YY's voice): "Were youâ€¦ late?"</p>

<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>Or maybe I'm justâ€¦</p>
<p>On time.</p>

<p>I'm not sure.</p>

<p>[pause]</p>

<p>That one shipperâ€¦</p>
<p>Who delivered late.</p>
<p>I sent a sharp email.</p>
<p>They didn't apologize.</p>
<p>Was thatâ€¦ deserved?</p>

<p>[pause]</p>

<p>Did I even stop to considerâ€¦</p>
<p>maybe he missed the deadline</p>
<p>because of a mortgage?</p>
<p>Interestâ€¦ spent elsewhere?</p>

<p>[pause]</p>

<p>Marriage.</p>
<p>Four kids.</p>
<p>Lessons learned daily.</p>
<p>Constant juggling of responsibilities.</p>

<p>[pause]</p>

<p>Lots of love.</p>
<p>Heated battles.</p>
<p>Scars, invisible to balance sheets.</p>
<p>Less and less timeâ€¦ for myself.</p>

<p>[pause]</p>

<p>I accepted the risk.</p>
<p>it was calculated.</p>
<p>Expensive.</p>
<p>Non-refundable.</p>

<p>[pause]</p>

<p>This project, consuming hours.</p>
<p>And hours.</p>
<p>Consuming creativity.</p>
<p>Consuming me.</p>
<p>Slowly.</p>

<p>[pause]</p>

<p>Risky.</p>
<p>Butâ€¦ still calculating.</p>

<p>[pause]</p>

<p>Managing work, family, and myself?</p>
<p>It isn't balance.</p>
<p>It's deciding what to borrow.</p>
<p>And paying the interest slowly.</p>

<p>[pause]</p>

<p>So many choices.</p>
<p>Many took their share,</p>
<p>Filled with interest.</p>
<p>No clear path.</p>

<p>But to me, the most important part</p>
<p>Was making them.</p>
<p>Choosing.</p>
<p>Foregoing one option</p>

<p>[pause]</p>

<p>Claiming another.</p>
<p>That's my best advice currently.</p>
<p>Thank you...  for asking.</p>

<p>[long pause]</p>

<p>(YY's voice): "...You look tired."</p>

<p>[pause]</p>

<p>This is costing a lot of energy.</p>
<p>Sizable debt, apparently.</p>

<p>[long pause]</p>

<p>Well..</p>

<p>(soft exhale)</p>

<p>That's our time.</p>
