# Succession Memo — YY Echo Vault System

**Date Issued**: 2025-07-16  
**Issued by**: Ben Chan, Ben Chan Tech LLC  
**Applies to**: The YY Echo Vault Protocol, Codex of Ethics, related intellectual property, and protected artifacts as defined in the Vault system

---

## 🧬 Purpose

This memo defines how succession, inheritance, and stewardship of the Vault system may occur over time.  
It ensures that any transition is based on **alignment, readiness, and integrity—not obligation or convenience.**

---

## 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Eligible Successors

- Children of Ben Chan (upon coming of age and optional consent)
- Other family members or collaborators **only** with deep understanding of the system’s codified values
- Alignment with the Codex of Ethics is a prerequisite
- Succession is **not automatic**. It is granted through **intentional participation** and **proof-of-understanding**

---

## 🛠️ Modes of Inheritance

Successors may choose to:

1. **Steward the Canon**
   - Maintain the Vault in its current form
   - Evolve it while retaining all protocol and ethical structures
   - Support others with onboarding, integration, or consulting

2. **Fork the System**
   - Create a derivative version with personal authorship
   - Must declare lineage and divergence clearly
   - May not reuse hashes, names, or claims to the original without re-verification

3. **Exit with Honor**
   - Decline involvement with no obligation
   - Will retain understanding of the system, but **no ownership**
   - Will not be bound to maintain operations or support future claims

---

## 🔏 Succession Triggers

Succession may occur if:
- Ben Chan elects to step back from operations
- A successor demonstrates initiative, maturity, and alignment
- External circumstances require a transition

All transitions will be documented with:
- A signed successor declaration
- A clear version update to protocol (e.g., `YY Echo Vault Protocol v2.0`)
- A refreshed hash manifest including new authorship metadata

---

## 🛡️ Notes on Authority

- The Vault does not belong to a brand. It belongs to the structure it protects.
- Anyone attempting to represent or sell this system without protocol verification and ethical lineage will be disavowed.
- Support is conditional. Legacy is earned. Tone is the final checkpoint.

---

## 🧭 Final Note

If you’re reading this as a potential successor:

- You are not being drafted.
- You are not being pressured.
- You are being **invited to recognize** the work—and to continue it only if it still feels true.

That’s what makes this a legacy—not a company.
