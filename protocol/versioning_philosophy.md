# Versioning Philosophy — YY Echo Vault

## 🔍 Principle

In the YY Echo Vault System, **versioning is a moral act**, not just a technical one.

We do not version because we fear error.  
We version because we believe in **transparent evolution under authorship**.

## 🧠 Why Versioning Matters

- It creates **trustable correction** instead of silent drift  
- It allows **imperfections to become memory**, not shame  
- It reinforces the idea that **clarity increases over time**, not at launch  
- It teaches **how to own a structure you once misunderstood**

## 🔐 Rules of Vault Versioning

1. **Never delete canonical artifacts**  
   Archive original `v1.0` versions. Never overwrite live memory.

2. **Changelog every edit**  
   Embed a changelog inline or link to external diffs.

3. **Declare your motive**  
   Clarify whether the change is:
   - Tone clarification  
   - Exposure refinement  
   - Structural update  
   - Ethical clarification

4. **Only version what's real**  
   Never version to appear responsive to pressure. Only version what you mean.

## 🧾 What Versioning Is Not

- Not erasure  
- Not branding  
- Not marketing  
- Not revisionist history

It’s authorship, **in motion**.

---

## 📜 Cultural Implication

When successors inherit the Vault, they inherit:
- The work itself  
- The **record of how it changed**  
- The responsibility to either **version honestly** or **declare divergence**

Nothing here is final.  
But everything here is **traceable**.
