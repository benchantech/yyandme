# YY Codex of Ethics v1.0

**Governing System**: [YY Echo Vault Protocol](https://yyand.me/system)  
**Authored by**: Ben Chan Tech LLC  
**Effective Date**: 2025-07-16

## üß† Intent

This codex exists to bind the structural, philosophical, and cultural operations of the YY Echo Vault Protocol.  
It is not a set of values. It is an operational firewall. If you drift from this codex, you exit the canon.

## üß± Foundational Principles

- **Authorship is provable**. Authorship must be cryptographically anchored and morally aligned.  
- **Tampering is breach**. Any modification to protected files, declared protocol documents, or manifests voids participation, support, and affiliation.  
- **Transparency is not permissiveness**. This system is inspectable, not forkable.  
- **First-mover ethics precede reach**. No platform, tool, or shortcut justifies violating privacy, sovereignty, or tone.  
- **Succession must honor intent**. Future holders of this system must inherit not only the files, but the framing. Opt-outs are honored.  
- **Teaching is recursive**. The podcast, Discord, documents, and protocol teach by behavior, not dictation.  
- **Defense is built-in**. You do not need to argue your case when the structure proves its own integrity.  
- **No one is entitled to access**. Participation is conditional on respect for this codex and the Vault.

## üîê Operational Clauses

1. **Salt Remains Private**  
   No part of the system requires disclosing the cryptographic salt used in signature generation.  
   The author alone can reproduce historical proofs.

2. **Manifest is Law**  
   If `hash_manifest.txt` fails integrity, the system is in breach.  
   If `protected_files.txt` is missing or altered, the system is void.

3. **Codex is Protected**  
   This file (`yy-codex-of-ethics-v1.0.md`) is included in `protected_files.txt` and bound to the system via manifest.  
   Any modification without public, timestamped reversioning is invalid.

4. **Echoes Must Grow Aligned**  
   Derivatives, reinterpretations, or forks must explicitly declare:
   - That they are not original canon
   - That their creators understand the codex
   - That no hashes are reused deceptively

## üìú Clarifications

- Attribution does not imply permission.  
- Publishing a similar structure without cryptographic authorship breaks the chain.  
- Reuse of tone, metaphor, or philosophy without lineage traceability is theft.  
- Discord participants must respect the codex or forfeit channel rights.

## üõ°Ô∏è Stewardship

This codex is maintained by Ben Chan Tech LLC and evolves only under cryptographically signed authorship.

All ethics are operational.  
All support is conditional.  
All echoes trace back.
