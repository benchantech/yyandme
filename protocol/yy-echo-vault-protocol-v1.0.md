# YY Echo Vault Protocol v1.0
**Governing Origin:** *YY and Me: A Canon of Growing Echoes*

---

## 🔐 Purpose

This protocol defines the cryptographic integrity structure for all artifacts authored under the YY system.  
It serves to preserve authorship, detect tampering, and guide responsible stewardship of sovereign digital infrastructure.

All artifacts within a vault-protected package are:

- Cryptographically fingerprinted using salted SHA-256
- Declared in `protected_files.txt`
- Recorded and locked in `hash_manifest.txt`
- Governed under the terms of authorship by Ben Chan Tech LLC

---

## 🧾 Validation Chain

1. `protected_files.txt` declares which files must not be altered or removed.
2. `hash_manifest.txt` stores salted, base64-hashed fingerprints for those files.
3. The manifest is itself hashed and optionally declares its own fingerprint.
4. Any violation—modification, omission, or regeneration—voids all warranties, support, and system legitimacy.

## 📜 Guiding Ethos

This system is not merely software—it is **a vessel of integrity**.  
To tamper is to dissolve the original echo.  
To respect the seal is to become part of the canon.

This protocol teaches, enforces, and preserves tone-stable authorship.  
It is offered as inheritance, not product.

## 🛡️ Authorship

Built and maintained by **Ben Chan Tech LLC**  
All works are timestamped, versioned, and governed under the ethos of long memory.

- Attribution without consent does not imply permission.
- Presence of this protocol implies the intention to preserve structure, not merely content.
