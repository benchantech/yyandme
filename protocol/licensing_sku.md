# Licensing and Authorship – SKU Edition

## 🧭 Purpose

This document defines the licensing, authorship, and transfer constraints for this SKU bundle.  
It is not a general open-source license. It is a **structural covenant**.

---

## 🔐 Scope of Authorship

All materials in this bundle were created and signed off by the original author as of:

**Signoff Timestamp**: [YYYY-MM-DD]  
**ZIP SHA256**: `[insert hash of bundle here]`  
**Signer**: Ben Chan, via `authorship-signoff.txt`

No edits made after that commit are governed by the original author.  
You may study, fork, and extend **only** with clear framing and declared divergence.

---

## ✅ What You May Do

- Read, study, and build from this structure  
- Teach others using the same ethics and protocol  
- Fork this system publicly **with a visible declaration of divergence**
- Reference or echo this system with proper lineage trace

---

## 🚫 What You May Not Do

- Claim authorship of materials up to the signoff point  
- Omit or obscure the origin or structural fingerprint  
- Sell, license, or repackage this system without new authorship declaration  
- Modify protected files without updating `hash_manifest.txt` and declaring a new canon

---

## 🧬 What This SKU Enables

- Cryptographically verifiable authorship
- Forkable structure with bounded divergence
- Educational transfer with proof-of-understanding artifacts
- A public, inspectable legacy anchor—not a subscription, not a brand
